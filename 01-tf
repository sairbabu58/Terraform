Terraform State:
-----------------

 -> Manage and maintained the existing and latest changes. what is the current state and what going to change. the latest changes only applied.
     Task 1: Show current state
     Task 2: Update your configuration
     Task 3: Plan and execute changes
     Task 4: Show new state

Note: 
1) terraform state file is holding all the resources details like, ec2 instance name, private ip, public ip, vpc, security group and so on.
2) You can also get the server ip details to access your server.
3) if you deleted terraform state file, and executed $terraform apply command it will create new resources. not validate the existing resources.




Terraform provider:
-------------------

1) Core (Linux, Mac, Windows)                                    #Where do you want to install
2) Plugins/provider (Aws, Azure,Google, Kubernetes, VmWare)      #Where do you want to configure/apply your code
3) Upstream APIs





Terraform Desired state: what is the terraform existing code. and you can create resources using existing  terraform code. (example: ec2 instance=t2.micro)
Terraform Current state: some one is manually stop the instance and edited the configuration. (example: instance from=t2.micro to=t2xlarge)

#https://registry.terraform.io/ -> browse provider -> aws -> click 'user provider'

$ terraform init (it will not work. cause .terraform.lock.hcl file will block it. to make it run this command, please remove .terraform.lock.hcl file)
