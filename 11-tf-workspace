# create terraform workspace for different env

Example: 
  1) you have already code for us-east-1
  2) now you want to deplay same resources on us-west-2
  3) for that create a new workspace and replace us-east-1 to us-west-2

$ terraform workspace
$ terraform workspace -help
$ terraform workspace new development
$ terraform workspace list
$ terraform workspace show
$ terraform workspace select default/development/prod
$ terraform show

$ terraform show (no resources are available)

#edit the code and update us-east-1 to us-west-2

$ terraform show
$ terraform plan 
$ terraform apply





$ vi main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
  default_tags {
    tags = {
      Environment = terraform.workspace
      Owner = "TF Hands On Lab"
      Project = "Infrastructure as Code"
      Terraform = "true"
      }
    }
}
